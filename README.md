# The-Footprint-Game
The Global Warming Online Game based on Shortest Route Algorithm.

The rules of the game are pretty simple:
1. Each cell represents an activity to be completed in order to link the first and the last cell in one continuous path.
2. The numbers in each cell indicate the amount of natural resources consumed (i.e. carbon footprint) by each activity.
3. Design a path using the least number of resources.
4. Use single-step vertical and horizontal hops only.
5. To backtrack, re-click on the last highlighted cell.

Reduce your carbon footprint. Save the world!
